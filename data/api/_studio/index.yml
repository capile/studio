      # Welcome to Studio CMS

      This is an administrative UI that allows direct manipulation of the database.
      **Handle with caution!** Some updates are irreversible and can lead to data loss or service disruption. If you're not sure what you should do, please contact support.

      To the left you'll find the data objects you're allowed to preview and possibly manage (the navigation bar can be hidden, showing only a small expandable border).


      Happy hacking!
